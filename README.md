FACTORIAL

A factorial is an operator that multiplies a number by all of the integers less than that number. For example, 5! = 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.

By definition, 0! = 1.

The `cool_factorial()` method is called on a fixnum, and returns the factorial of that number.

For example:

```ruby
> 5.cool_factorial()
> 21
```
